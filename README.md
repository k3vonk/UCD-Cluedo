# Cluedo

Cluedo is a murder mystery board game that is for two to six players. As part of this project, Cluedo was redeveloped into a virtual software where friends can play on a singular laptop. 

# Features
* Move characters (l, r, u, d)
* Roll dice (roll)
* Guess
* Notes (store information)
* Log (to check what the game state and past guesses)

The UI to play or quit the game. Note: the play button UI seems to display differently depending on platform. 

# Game Setup
![Game Setup](https://github.com/k3vonk/UCD-Cluedo/blob/master/Game%20Images/First%20window.png) 
The initial start of the game, is the setup. The initiator can pick the amount of players for this current game session. Each user can then choose a personal name and pick a game character - as seen on the JFrame.

# Example Scenario
![example](https://github.com/k3vonk/UCD-Cluedo/blob/master/Game%20Images/game.png)
The first player (Plum) has rolled 7 and can now move 7 steps. 


# AI Challenge
As part of this project, we were given a seperate cluedo solution. This solution provided bots that we could implement and challenge other teams. Our design included several verbal solutions from Reddit, online resources, and personal ideas. All strategies can be seen on the Sprint05 branch.
Our bot ended up winning 3rd place in our in-house competition against ~15 teams.
